    <h2>Call for Papers</h2>
    <p>
    Digital Twins (DTs) have received a lot of attantion over the past years and have been applied in various applications. More recently, their potential has also been identified for autonomous systems, allowing systems to build and refine their model about themselves during runtime. This is particularly useful for systems operating in changing environments, able to learn about themselves. With this, DTs take a step out of individual and specialised industrial applications and into the realm of autonomous systems.
    </p>    

    <p>However, a wide range of challenges needs to be solved in order to ensure feasible utilisation of DTs in autonomous systems and swarms. These include the need for develoment approaches and tools for autonomous systems enabled by DTs; novel architectures for autonomous systems operating in combintation with DTs, utilising DTs for planning of individual and collaborative tasks, sharing DTs, and decision-processes incorporating DTs; machine learning techniques to improve DTs in a continual manner; coordination, balancing, and support mechanisms to ensure efficient simulation of DTs; adaptation and refinement of DTs during runtime to cope with changing situation in the computing environment and the real-world; verfication techniques to ensure correctness and trustworthiness of systems using DTs; as well as real-world applications and it’s challenges when applying DTs in autonomous systems and swarms.
        </p>
        <p>
    For this first edition of the DAT workshop, we invite submissions that address these challenges and provide novel solutions to enable autonomous systems using DTs. We are specifically interested in full scientific papers (max 6 pages) that present novel ideas, concepts, and approaches. We also invite authors to submit shorter vision papers (max 4 pages) that present topics of future interest and work-in-progress.
    </p>
    Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Development and engineering approaches and tools</strong> for autonomous systems enabled by DTs</li>
        <li><strong>Novel architectures</strong> for autonomous systems incorporating and employing DTs in their operation, from individual decision-making to multi-system collaboration and swarms</li>
        <li><strong>Approaches incorporating Machine Learning</strong> with DTs, potentially in a continual manner</li>
        <li><strong>Coordination, balancing, and support mechanisms to ensure efficient simulation</strong>  of DTs for individual systems and swarms from pure cloud solutions to as well as the full spectrum of the edge cloud continuum</li>
        <li><strong>Techniques and mechanisms to adapt and refine DTs</strong> during runtime to cope with changing situations in the computing environment and the real-world</li>
        <li><strong>Verification techniques</strong> employing DTs for autonomous systems to ensure correctness and trustworthiness</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Paper Submission</h2>
    <p>Papers must represent original and unpublished work that is not currently under review. Papers will be judged on originality, significance, interest, correctness, clarity, and relevance to the broader community.
      </p>
      <p>
      We solicit ongoing research submissions (6 pages) reporting on experiences, measurements, user studies, and providing an appropriate quantitative evaluation if possible.
      We also solicit position papers (4 pages) as a basis for discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
      The proceedings of all ACSOS workshops will be published by IEEE Computer Society Press and made available as a part of the IEEE digital library. In addition, papers will be part of the conference proceedings with ISBN number. Indexing by IEEE explore and DBPL is expected.
      </p>
      <p>
      Submissions should be formatted according to the IEEE Computer Society Press proceedings style guide and submitted electronically in PDF format.
      </p>
